# Manufacturing AI Agent Architecture

## Runtime Flow

```text
User Request
  -> RootManufacturingGraph
  -> Checkpoint v2 thread lookup (thread_id = user_id:session_id)
  -> ContextSubAgent
  -> IntentGateway / structured classifier
  -> selected path
  -> answer node or PlanningSubAgent + manufacturing path
  -> RagEvidenceSubAgent when document evidence is required
  -> SafetySubAgent when safety gates are required
  -> FormatterRegistry
  -> MemorySubAgent
  -> checkpoint v2 save
```

`root_graph.py` is the top-level orchestration boundary. Context resolution,
context packing, planning, RAG evidence, safety policy, and memory update are
handled by dedicated LangGraph SubAgents with their own request-scoped state.

## ContextResolution

`ContextResolver` receives only:

- `current_user_message`
- `last_answer_memory`
- `recent_turns`
- `rolling_summary`

It does not receive raw RAG documents, full conversation history, formatter
context, or legacy focus fields. It returns a structured `ContextResolution`
with:

- `is_followup`
- `followup_type`
- `followup_target`
- `followup_item_index`
- `standalone_query`
- `context_needed`
- `confidence`
- `reason`

Examples:

- `왜?` with answer memory -> `previous_answer_reason`
- `방금 권장조치 순서대로 알려줘` -> `previous_recommended_actions`
- `그중 2번은 왜 필요한데?` -> `previous_recommended_action_item`
- `LOTO가 뭐야?` -> standalone concept question, even if the previous answer was heavy analysis

## ContextPackBuilder

`ContextPackBuilder` creates node-specific context contracts:

- `classifier_context`
- `answer_context`
- `rag_context`
- `safety_context`
- `formatter_context`
- `memory_writer_context`

The classifier context is intentionally small. It can include the current
message, standalone query, follow-up metadata, last answer summary/focus, recent
turn intents, and glossary summary. It must not include retrieved document
text, raw messages, full conversation history, safety manuals, raw exceptions,
or the full root state.

`recommended_actions` is only included in `formatter_context` when
`answer_type == recommended_action_recap`. A single action item is only included
when `answer_type == recommended_action_item_explanation`.

## FormatterRegistry

`FormatterRegistry` renders already-decided routes. Formatters do not infer
intent from the user question.

Current formatter keys:

- `fast_concept_answer`
- `general_lightweight_answer`
- `recommended_action_recap`
- `recommended_action_item_explanation`
- `safety_answer`
- `clarification`
- explicit degrade path

This prevents the old problem where a lightweight answer could accidentally
inherit the heavy analysis format (`판정`, `위험도`, `권장 조치`, etc.).

## SafetyPolicy

Safety routing is not decided by the formatter. Once a route requires safety,
`SafetyPolicy` builds a `SafetyContext` containing:

- `must_include`
- `forbidden`
- `disclaimer_level`
- `requires_professional_review`
- `allowed_scope`

`SafetyFormatter` renders this safety context. Fast concept answers should not
receive a full safety checklist unless the route explicitly requires it.

## AnswerMemory

Legacy state fields are removed:

- `last_focus`
- `last_answer_claims`
- `last_answer_key_phrases`
- top-level `recommended_actions`

The single answer-memory object is:

- `selected_path`
- `answer_type`
- `user_intent`
- `short_summary`
- `focus`
- `key_points`
- `claims`
- `recommended_actions`
- `decisions`
- `code_changes`
- `tables`
- `mentioned_entities`
- `unresolved_questions`
- `source_refs`
- `safety_level`
- `created_at`
- `expires_after_turns`

`AnswerMemory.recommended_actions` is always a list of structured
`RecommendedAction` objects:

- `id`
- `title`
- `rationale`
- `safety_note`
- `priority`

String actions from existing tools or LLM output are normalized before being
stored internally.

## Checkpoint v2 Policy

Checkpoint state is v2-only:

- `state_schema_version = 2`
- `thread_id = user_id:session_id`
- v1 checkpoints are not migrated
- v1 checkpoints are ignored by `_checkpoint_values`
- default SQLite file uses a v2 name: `langgraph_checkpoints_v2.sqlite3`

Checkpointed state is sanitized to primitives only:

- allowed: `dict`, `list`, `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `None`
- not allowed: Pydantic models, `AgentRequest`, `AgentResponse`, LangChain
  messages, or arbitrary Python objects

The reset helper removes only the v2 checkpoint file:

```bash
cd ai_server
../.venv312/bin/python -m app.agent.checkpointing.reset
```

## Hard Gate Audit

Hard gates are retained only where they protect safety, tool scope, or obvious
no-LLM paths. Semantic follow-up decisions are handled by `ContextResolver` and
the intent classifier. Gate definitions live under `app/agent/routing/`.

| Location | Terms | Purpose | Misclassification Prevented | Final Decision or Candidate Signal | Tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ControlScopeGate` | stop/start/control terms | refuse direct machine control | treating unsafe control as normal Q&A | final safety/scope gate | gateway tests |
| `MetaFeedbackGate` | bug/context/routing feedback | route product feedback away from manufacturing analysis | heavy report format on system feedback | final meta route | `test_meta_feedback_preserves_focus_policy` |
| `ProcessDataDiagnosisGate` | risk/failure/current condition terms with process data | force real process-data questions to heavy analysis | lightweight answer for risk judgement | final hard gate only when `process_data` exists | `test_process_data_risk_question_is_hard_gated_to_supervisor` |
| `SafetyRequestGate` | safety/maintenance terms | require safety-aware planning | unsafe lightweight maintenance advice | final safety hard gate | `test_safety_request_is_not_lightweight` |
| `DocumentRequestGate` | document/source terms | route document-backed question to RAG | unsupported citation request | final lightweight RAG gate | gateway tests |
| `GlossaryConceptGate` | simple concept terms + glossary hit | no-LLM glossary fast path | unnecessary LLM/heavy path for concepts | final no-LLM fast path, only with glossary hit | `test_no_llm_glossary_concept_uses_fast_path` |
| `RecommendedActionFollowupGate` | `ContextResolution.followup_type` | route action recap/item follow-ups to dedicated formatters | action recap falling into `general_lightweight_answer` | final follow-up gate after ContextResolver | `test_recommended_action_followup_routes_to_recap_not_lightweight` |
| `FollowupCandidateGate` | pronoun/reason/action signals | expose a candidate signal only | candidate signal accidentally selecting a path | candidate signal, never final | `test_followup_candidate_gate_does_not_make_final_route_decision` |
| `followup_signals.py` markers | pronoun/reason/action signals | produce resolver input signals | treating short follow-up as standalone | candidate signal only | `ContextResolver` tests |
| `DeterministicDiagnosticPolicy` | manufacturing planning hints | deterministic heavy-route policy | missing RAG/safety/prediction stages in heavy path | structured `DiagnosticPlan`, then converted to `AgentPlan` | `test_supervisor_keyword_policy_is_hidden_behind_diagnostic_planner`, `test_diagnostic_planner_returns_structured_plan` |

Risk note: deterministic manufacturing planning still exists, but it is hidden
behind `DiagnosticPlanner` and represented as a structured `DiagnosticPlan`
before the rest of the graph sees it. Root graph callers should not inspect
keyword matches directly.

## Heavy Manufacturing Path Audit

The heavy path is separated by root nodes and SubAgents:

- `supervisor_planning`: invokes `PlanningSubAgent`
- `manufacturing_analysis`: prediction and domain context
- `evidence_retrieval`: invokes `RagEvidenceSubAgent`
- `safety`: invokes `SafetySubAgent`
- `response_synthesis`: LLM answer composition and safety validation
- `response_packager`: public response object
- `focus_updater`: invokes `MemorySubAgent`

Remaining coupling:

- `SupervisorService` still owns LLM refinement and replan behavior, but
  deterministic planning is isolated behind `DiagnosticPlanner`.
- Manufacturing analysis and response synthesis remain root-level nodes.

Current heavy modules:

1. `DiagnosticPlanner`
2. `RagQueryPlanner`
3. `RagEvidenceSubAgent`
4. `EvidenceFilter`
5. `EvidenceGrader`
6. `CitationBuilder`
7. `SafetyGateBuilder`
8. `RecommendationBuilder`
9. `StructuredAnswerPayloadBuilder`

RAG role contracts:

| Component | Responsibility | Explicit Non-Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RagQueryPlanner` | build retrieval request/query | no retrieval execution |
| `RagEvidenceSubAgent` | coordinate query planning, retrieval, filtering, grading, citation, and trace | no prediction or final answer composition |
| `RagService` / `ChromaRetriever` | execute Chroma search | no query planning, grading, or JSONL fallback in production |
| `EvidenceFilter` | dedupe and remove empty evidence | no relevance grading |
| `EvidenceGrader` | decide usable/weak evidence | no citation building |
| `CitationBuilder` | build citations from graded evidence | no retrieval or grading |

Legacy graph removal audit:

| Removed Method | Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| removed RAG query helper | `RagQueryPlanner.plan` |
| removed evidence term helper | `EvidenceGrader.grade` |
| removed action phrase helper | `RecommendationBuilder.collect_action_phrases` |
| removed safety guidance helper | `SafetyGateBuilder.safety_guidance` |
| removed warning helper | `SafetyGateBuilder.warnings` |
| removed payload helper | `StructuredAnswerPayloadBuilder.build` |

Recommended next work:

1. promote RAG query/retrieve/filter/grade/citation classes into LangGraph
   subgraph nodes with local replan edges
2. make `RecommendationBuilder` produce rich rationale/safety notes from domain
   catalog metadata
3. keep root graph dependencies explicit; do not reintroduce compatibility
   wrappers

## Current Guarantees

- New concept questions are not polluted by prior heavy answers.
- Follow-up action recap uses structured `AnswerMemory.recommended_actions`.
- Action item explanations use the selected action's `rationale` and
  `safety_note`.
- Checkpoint snapshots are JSON-like and include `state_schema_version = 2`.
- Different `user_id/session_id` pairs do not share `last_answer_memory`.
- Deterministic heavy-path keyword planning is represented as `DiagnosticPlan`
  behind `DiagnosticPlanner`.
- RAG responsibilities are separated into query planning, retrieval, filtering,
  grading, and citation building classes.

## Remaining Risks

- `DeterministicDiagnosticPolicy` is hidden behind `DiagnosticPlanner`, but the
  next step is to make planning consume richer
  `IntentResult` and `ContextPacks` signals.
- RAG roles are split into classes, but they are not yet fully separate
  LangGraph subgraph nodes with independent retry, latency, and quality metrics.
- The legacy imperative graph module is removed. Root graph and the RAG
  Evidence SubAgent call dedicated modules directly.
